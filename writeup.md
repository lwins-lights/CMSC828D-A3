## Preparation
### PostgreSQL
* Please give the user (`cmsc828d` by default) the ___superuser___ privilege, otherwise the server cannot automatically load the table `nations` from `data/nations.csv`.

## Acknowledgment
* The data is downloaded from a course [homepage](https://paldhous.github.io/ucb/2016/dataviz/datasets.html) of Peter Aldhous. It is accredited to [World Bank Indicators](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/all) portal.
* I learnt advanced usage of D3.js [here](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery).
